    <section>  <p class="text-div">Michael the Brave (Romanian: Mihai Viteazul [miˈhaj viˈte̯azul] or Mihai Bravu [ˈbravu]; 1558 – 9 August 1601), born as Mihai Pătrașcu, was the Prince of Wallachia (as Michael II, 1593 – 1601), Prince of Moldavia (1600) and de facto ruler of Transylvania (1599 – 1600). He is considered one of Romania's greatest national heroes.[2] Since the 19th century, Michael the Brave has been regarded by Romanian nationalists as a symbol of Romanian unity,[3] as his reign marked the first time all principalities inhabited by Romanians were under the same ruler.</p></section>

      <p class="text-div">In April 1598, Sigismund resigned as Prince of Transylvania in favor of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary); reversed his decision in October 1598; and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Báthory, his cousin.[23] Báthory had strong ties to the Polish chancellor and hetman Jan Zamoyski and placed Transylvania under the influence of the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa. He was also a trusted ally of the new Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă, one of Michael's greatest enemies.[22] Movilă had deposed Ștefan Răzvan with the help of Polish hetman Jan Zamoyski in August 1595.[22]

Having to face this new threat, Michael asked Emperor Rudolf to become the sovereign of Wallachia. On 25 September (5 October) Báthory issued an ultimatum demanding that Michael abandon his throne.[24] Michael decided to attack Andrew Cardinal Báthory immediately to prevent invasion. </p></section>
